        <h3>Param Vir Chakra</h3><br>
        <p>
            Vikram Batra was awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military honour on 15 August 1999, the 52nd
            anniversary of India's independence. His father G.L. Batra received the honour for his deceased son from the
            President of India, the late K. R. Narayanan. <br>
            During 'Operation Vijay', on 20 June 1999, Captain Vikram Batra, Commander Delta Company was tasked to
            attack Point 5140. Captain Batra with his company skirted around the feature from the East and maintaining
            surprise reached within assaulting distance of the enemy. Captain Batra reorganized his column and motivated
            his men to physically assault the enemy positions. Leading from the front, he in a daredevil assault,
            pounced on the enemy and killed four of them in a hand-to hand fight. On 7 July 1999, in another operation
            in the area Pt 4875, his company was tasked to clear a narrow feature with sharp cuttings on either side and
            heavily fortified enemy defences that covered the only approach to it. For speedy operation, Captain Batra
            assaulted the enemy position along a narrow ridge and engaged the enemy in a fierce hand-to-hand fight and
            killed five enemy soldiers at point blank range. Despite sustaining grave injuries, he crawled towards the
            enemy and hurled grenades clearing the position with utter disregard to his personal safety, leading from
            the front, he rallied his men and pressed on the attack and achieved a near impossible military task in the
            face of heavy enemy fire. The officer, however, succumbed to his injuries. Inspired by his daredevil act,
            his troops fell upon the enemy with vengeance, annihilated them and captured Point 4875.

            Captain Vikram Batra, thus, displayed the most conspicuous personal bravery and leadership of the highest
            order in the face of the enemy and made the supreme sacrifice in the highest traditions of the Indian Army.

            Girdhari Lal Batra, a government school principal, and Kamal Kanta Batra, a school teacher. He was the elder
            of
            twin sons, born fourteen minutes before his brother, Vishal. The twins were nicknamed: 'Luv' (Vikram) and
            'Kush'

            middle standard. He received his senior secondary education at Central School in Palampur.

        <h3>Military Career</h3><br>
        <p>
            Batra joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA) at Dehradun, in June 1996 in the Manekshaw Battalion. After
            completing his 19-month training course, he graduated from the IMA on 6 December 1997 and was commissioned
            as a
            lieutenant into the Indian Army. He was commissioned into the 13th battalion of the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles
            (13 JAK Rif). After commissioning, he was sent to Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh for regimental training. The
            training
            lasted one month, from December 1997 to the end of January 1998.
        </p><br>
        <p>On completion of this training he got his first posting at Sopore in Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir,
            an area with significant militant activity. In mid-March 1998, he was sent to the Infantry School at
            Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, where young Army officers are trained, for the Young Officer's Course. This training
            lasted five months until September 1998. Following completion of the course and being awarded alpha grading,
            he joined his battalion in Sopore in October 1998.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            During his posting in Sopore, Batra had several encounters with militants. In one of those encounters when
            Batra was leading an ambush with his platoon into an area of dense forest, he escaped when bullet fired by a
            militant grazed his shoulder and struck one of Batra's men behind him, who was killed. Batra ordered his men
            to fire on the militants, and by morning all of the militants were killed. He believed that the
            bullet was meant for him and not his colleague.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Kargil War</h3><br>
        <p>
            Batra's battalion, the 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles (13 JAK Rif), reached Dras on 6 June, was placed under
            the command of 56 Mountain Brigade, and was given orders to act as reserves to the 2nd battalion of the
            Rajputana Rifles (2 Raj Rif) during their attack on Tololing mountain.[31] The 18th battalion of The
            Grenadiers (18 Grenadiers) first attacked Tololing on 22 May, but were unable to capture the
            peak. 18 Grenadiers made four attempts to capture Tololing. but could only succeed in
            securing the lower slopes,[38][39] while suffering heavy casualties. Eventually, 2 Raj Rif was
            assigned the mission of capturing Tololing and they did so on 13 June 1999.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Capture of Point 5140</h3><br>
        <p>
            The task of capturing Point 5140, a strategically important mountain peak in the Dras sector, was assigned
            to 13 JAK Rif under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Yogesh Kumar Joshi on 17 June 1999. After the
            capture of Rocky Knob, located at the base of Point 5140 and about 800 metres away, Humps IX and X
            (part of Hump Complex, consisting of about ten high grounds numbered I to X on the same ridgeline about
            500-700 metres north of Point 4590) on 17 June, the battalion's commanding officer, Joshi, fell back
            to Tololing, and started planning for their next objective â€” Point 5140. Point 5140, about 1500
            metres north of Tololing on the same ridgeline, is at an altitude of 16,962 feet above sea level and
            overlooks the Tololing nullah. It is the highest point on the Tololing ridgeline and the most
            formidable feature in the Dras sub-sector.
            Capture of Point 4875
        </p><br>
        <h3>Capture of Point 4875</h3><br>
        <p>
            Upon reaching Mushkoh Valley, the 13 JAK Rifles was placed under the command of 79 Mountain Brigade. The
            next assignment for Batra's battalion was to capture the Point 4875, a strategically important peak located
            in the Mushkoh Valley. Since the feature dominated the National Highway 1 completely from Dras to
            Matayan, it became imperative for the Indian Army to capture Point 4875. A stretch of 30-40
            kilometres of the national highway was under direct observation of the enemy. From Point 4875, Pakistani
            artillery observers could easily see Indian gun positions, army camps and troop movement, and bring down
            effective artillery fire at will.
